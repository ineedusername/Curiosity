                Curiosity comprised 23 percent of the mass of the 3,893 kg (8,583 lb) Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft,
                which had the sole mission of delivering the rover safely across space from Earth to a soft landing on the surface of Mars.
                The remaining mass of the MSL craft was discarded in the process of carrying out this task.

                <br><b>Dimensions:</b><br>Curiosity has a mass of 899 kg (1,982 lb) including 80 kg (180 lb) of scientific instruments.[20] The rover is
                2.9 m (9.5 ft) long by 2.7 m (8.9 ft) wide by 2.2 m (7.2 ft) in height.

                <br><b>Power source:</b><br> Curiosity is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), like the successful Viking 1 and Viking 2
                Mars landers in 1976.
                Radioisotope power systems (RPSs) are generators that produce electricity from the decay of radioactive isotopes, such as plutonium-238,
                which is a non-fissile isotope of plutonium. Heat given off by the decay of this isotope is converted into electric voltage by thermocouples,
                providing constant power during all seasons and through the day and night. Waste heat can be used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical
                power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments.[22][23] Curiosity's RTG is fueled by 4.8 kg (11 lb) of plutonium-238 dioxide supplied by
                the U.S. Department of Energy.

                Curiosity is powered by a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), designed and built by Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy
                Systems under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy,[25][26] and assembled and tested by the Idaho National Laboratory.[27] Based on
                legacy RTG technology, it represents a more flexible and compact development step,[28] and is designed to produce 125 watts of electrical
                power from about 2,000 watts of thermal power at the start of the mission.[22][23] The MMRTG produces less power over time as its plutonium
                fuel decays: at its minimum lifetime of 14 years, electrical power output is down to 100 watts.[29][30] The power source will generate 9 MJ
                (2.5 kWh) each day, much more than the solar panels of the Mars Exploration Rovers, which can generate about 2.1 MJ (0.58 kWh) each day.
                The electrical output from the MMRTG charges two rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. This enables the power subsystem to meet peak power
                demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the generator’s steady output level. Each battery has a capacity of about 42 ampere-hours.
                <br><b>Heat rejection system:</b><br> The temperatures at the landing site can vary from −127 to 40 °C (−197 to 104 °F); therefore, the thermal system will
                warm the rover for most of the Martian year. The thermal system will do so in several ways: passively, through the dissipation to internal components;
                by electrical heaters strategically placed on key components; and by using the rover heat rejection system (HRS).[31] It uses fluid pumped through 60 m
                (200 ft) of tubing in the rover body so that sensitive components are kept at optimal temperatures.[32] The fluid loop serves the additional purpose
                of rejecting heat when the rover has become too warm, and it can also gather waste heat from the power source by pumping fluid through two heat exchangers
                that are mounted alongside the RTG. The HRS also has the ability to cool components if necessary.[32]
                <br><b>Computers:</b><br> The two identical on-board rover computers, called Rover Computer Element (RCE) contain radiation hardened memory to tolerate the extreme
                radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. Each computer's memory includes 256 kB of EEPROM, 256 MB of DRAM, and 2 GB of flash memory.
                For comparison, the Mars Exploration Rovers used 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory.
                The RCE computers use the RAD750 CPU, which is a successor to the RAD6000 CPU of the Mars Exploration Rovers.[35][36] The RAD750 CPU, a radiation-hardened
                version of the PowerPC 750, can execute up to 400 MIPS, while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to only 35 MIPS.[37][38] Of the two on-board computers, one
                is configured as backup and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer.[33] On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup
                computer due to an issue with the then active computer's flash memory, which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The backup computer was
                turned on in safe mode and subsequently returned to active status on March 4.[39] The same issue happened in late March, resuming full operations on March 25, 2013.
                The rover has an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation.[33] The rover's computers are
                constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature.[33] Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and
                operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover.[33] The rover installed its full surface operations
                software after the landing because its computers did not have sufficient main memory available during flight. The new software essentially replaced the flight software

            <h1 text align="center">Goals and objectives</h1>
            <p>
                As established by the Mars Exploration Program, the main scientific goals of the MSL mission are to help determine whether
                Mars could ever have supported life, as well as determining the role of water, and to study the climate and geology of Mars.
                The mission will also help prepare for human exploration.
                To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight main scientific objectives:
                <br><b>Biological</b><br>
                Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds<br>
                Investigate the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur)<br>
                Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes (biosignatures and biomolecules)
                <br><b>Geological and geochemical</b><br>
                Investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials<br>
                Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils
                <br><b>Planetary process</b><br>
                Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) Martian atmospheric evolution processes<br>
                Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide
                <br><b>Surface radiation</b><br>
                Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including galactic and cosmic radiation, solar proton events and secondary
                neutrons. As part of its exploration, it also measured the radiation exposure in the interior of the spacecraft as it traveled to
                Mars, and it is continuing radiation measurements as it explores the surface of Mars. This data would be important for a future
                manned mission. About one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to
                microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process of organic
                compounds and biomolecules; a branch of paleontology called taphonomy.

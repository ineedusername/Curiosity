                Curiosity has an advanced payload of scientific equipment on Mars. It is the fourth NASA unmanned surface rover sent to Mars since 1996.
                Previous successful Mars rovers are Sojourner from the Mars Pathfinder mission (1997), and Spirit (2004–2010) and Opportunity (2004–present)
                rovers from the Mars Exploration Rover mission.

                Curiosity is 2.9 m (9.5 ft) long by 2.7 m (8.9 ft) wide by 2.2 m (7.2 ft) in height,[21] larger than Mars Exploration Rovers, which are 1.5 m
                (4.9 ft) long and have a mass of 174 kg (384 lb) including 6.8 kg (15 lb) of scientific instruments. In comparison to Pancam on
                the Mars Exploration Rovers, the MastCam-34 has 1.25× higher spatial resolution and the MastCam-100 has 3.67× higher spatial resolution.

                The region the rover is set to explore has been compared to the Four Corners region of the North American west. Gale Crater has an area
                similar to Connecticut and Rhode Island combined.

                Colin Pillinger, leader of the Beagle 2 project, reacted emotionally to the large number of technicians monitoring Curiosity's descent, because
                Beagle 2 had only four people monitoring it. The Beagle 2 team made a virtue out of necessity; it was known that there was no chance of
                obtaining funds in Europe, at that time, of the scale previously considered necessary for a Mars rover, so the team used innovative methods to
                reduce the cost to less than 4% of the cost of the Curiosity mission. They also had only one shot, with no funding for repeat missions
                (it was named Beagle 2 as a successor to HMS Beagle, not to an earlier rover). It was considered a large risk, and, although Beagle 2 did successfully
                survive its entry, descent, and landing, incomplete deployment of the solar panels hampered communication back to Earth. The team has proposed that a
                future launch might take multiple low-cost Beagle-type landers, with a realistic expectation that the vast majority would be successful, allowing exploration
                of several parts of Mars and possibly asteroids, all for considerably less cost than a single "normal" rover expedition.
